Real Estate Listing Criteria Search Selector Must be written in clean, original code and not copied from a template. Generated in Bootstrap 4 and fully responsive (scalable across screen sizes). We need a Realtor.com style (see link below) criteria search that is w3 compliant, and USA ADA accessibility compliant. For compliance and coding issues, it will be tested on (https://www.powermapper.com/) https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Rolla_MO City (should operate similar to the price field. Rather than only allowing the user to type a city, it should list cities in a select field, and allow you to start typing a city which would then narrow down possible options) A list of cities for testing will be provided in the cities.txt file. Price (min and max price options, with ability to either type in a price in either field, or when clicking the input field allow a preselected amount to be chosen like on Realtor.com) Beds (Same as realtor.com) Baths (Same as realtor.com) Property Type (Same as realtor.com except for no icons) List of Property types provided in proptypes.txt file. All of these fields should be contained in a form field. Instead of a “Save Search” button to the right, a “Submit Search” button should be located there.
